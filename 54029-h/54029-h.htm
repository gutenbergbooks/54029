<h2><span class="lsp2">PREFACE.</span></h2>
<hr class="r15" />

<p class="noindent">The character and credit of the British Army must
chiefly depend upon the zeal and ardour by which
all who enter into its service are animated, and
consequently it is of the highest importance that any
measure calculated to excite the spirit of emulation,
by which alone great and gallant actions are achieved,
should be adopted.</p>

<p>Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment
of this desirable object than a full display of the noble
deeds with which the Military History of our country
abounds. To hold forth these bright examples to
the imitation of the youthful soldier, and thus to
incite him to emulate the meritorious conduct of those
who have preceded him in their honorable career,
are among the motives that have given rise to the
present publication.</p>

<p>The operations of the British Troops are, indeed,
announced in the "London Gazette," from whence
they are transferred into the public prints: the
achievements of our armies are thus made known at
the time of their occurrence, and receive the tribute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
of praise and admiration to which they are entitled.
On extraordinary occasions, the Houses of Parliament
have been in the habit of conferring on the Commanders,
and the Officers and Troops acting under
their orders, expressions of approbation and of thanks
for their skill and bravery; and these testimonials,
confirmed by the high honour of their Sovereign's
approbation, constitute the reward which the soldier
most highly prizes.</p>

<p>It has not, however, until late years, been the practice
(which appears to have long prevailed in some of
the Continental armies) for British Regiments to keep
regular records of their services and achievements.
Hence some difficulty has been experienced in obtaining,
particularly from the old Regiments, an authentic
account of their origin and subsequent services.</p>

<p>This defect will now be remedied, in consequence
of His Majesty having been pleased to command
that every Regiment shall, in future, keep a full and
ample record of its services at home and abroad.</p>

<p>From the materials thus collected, the country
will henceforth derive information as to the difficulties
and privations which chequer the career of those who
embrace the military profession. In Great Britain,
where so large a number of persons are devoted to
the active concerns of agriculture, manufactures,
and commerce, and where these pursuits have, for so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
long a period, being undisturbed by the <em>presence of
war</em>, which few other countries have escaped, comparatively
little is known of the vicissitudes of active
service and of the casualties of climate, to which,
even during peace, the British Troops are exposed in
every part of the globe, with little or no interval of
repose.</p>

<p>In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which
the country derives from the industry and the enterprise
of the agriculturist and the trader, its happy
inhabitants may be supposed not often to reflect on
the perilous duties of the soldier and the sailor,&mdash;on
their sufferings,&mdash;and on the sacrifice of valuable life,
by which so many national benefits are obtained and
preserved.</p>

<p>The conduct of the British Troops, their valour,
and endurance, have shone conspicuously under great
and trying difficulties; and their character has been
established in Continental warfare by the irresistible
spirit with which they have effected debarkations in
spite of the most formidable opposition, and by the
gallantry and steadiness with which they have maintained
their advantages against superior numbers.</p>

<p>In the official Reports made by the respective Commanders,
ample justice has generally been done to
the gallant exertions of the Corps employed; but
the details of their services and of acts of individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
bravery can only be fully given in the Annals of the
various Regiments.</p>

<p>These Records are now preparing for publication,
under his Majesty's special authority, by Mr.
<span class="smcap">Richard Cannon</span>, Principal Clerk of the Adjutant
General's Office; and while the perusal of them cannot
fail to be useful and interesting to military men
of every rank, it is considered that they will also
afford entertainment and information to the general
reader, particularly to those who may have served in
the Army, or who have relatives in the Service.</p>

<p>There exists in the breasts of most of those who
have served, or are serving, in the Army, an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esprit
de Corps</i>&mdash;an attachment to everything belonging
to their Regiment; to such persons a narrative of
the services of their own Corps cannot fail to prove
interesting. Authentic accounts of the actions of
the great, the valiant, the loyal, have always been
of paramount interest with a brave and civilized
people. Great Britain has produced a race of heroes
who, in moments of danger and terror, have stood
"firm as the rocks of their native shore:" and when
half the world has been arrayed against them, they
have fought the battles of their Country with unshaken
fortitude. It is presumed that a record of
achievements in war,&mdash;victories so complete and surprising,
gained by our countrymen, our brothers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
our fellow citizens in arms,&mdash;a record which revives
the memory of the brave, and brings their gallant
deeds before us,&mdash;will certainly prove acceptable to
the public.</p>

<p>Biographical Memoirs of the Colonels and other
distinguished Officers will be introduced in the
Records of their respective Regiments, and the
Honorary Distinctions which have, from time to
time, been conferred upon each Regiment, as testifying
the value and importance of its services, will be
faithfully set forth.</p>

<p>As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record
of each Regiment will be printed in a distinct number,
so that when the whole shall be completed, the
Parts may be bound up in numerical succession.</p>

<hr class="r20a" />

<p class="p2 noindent">The natives of Britain have, at all periods, been
celebrated for innate courage and unshaken firmness,
and the national superiority of the British troops
over those of other countries has been evinced in
the midst of the most imminent perils. History contains
so many proofs of extraordinary acts of bravery,
that no doubts can be raised upon the facts which
are recorded. It must therefore be admitted, that
the distinguishing feature of the British soldier is
<span class="smcap">Intrepidity</span>. This quality was evinced by the
inhabitants of England when their country was
invaded by Julius Cæsar with a Roman army, on
which occasion the undaunted Britons rushed into
the sea to attack the Roman soldiers as they descended
from their ships; and, although their discipline
and arms were inferior to those of their
adversaries, yet their fierce and dauntless bearing
intimidated the flower of the Roman troops, including
Cæsar's favourite tenth legion. Their arms
consisted of spears, short swords, and other weapons
of rude construction. They had chariots, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
axles of which were fastened sharp pieces of iron
resembling scythe-blades, and infantry in long
chariots resembling waggons, who alighted and
fought on foot, and for change of ground, pursuit
or retreat, sprang into the chariot and drove off
with the speed of cavalry. These inventions were,
however, unavailing against Cæsar's legions: in
the course of time a military system, with discipline
and subordination, was introduced, and
British courage, being thus regulated, was exerted
to the greatest advantage; a full development of
the national character followed, and it shone forth
in all its native brilliancy.</p>

<p>The military force of the Anglo-Saxons consisted
principally of infantry: Thanes, and other men of
property, however, fought on horseback. The
infantry were of two classes, heavy and light
The former carried large shields armed with spikes,
long broad swords and spears; and the latter were
armed with swords or spears only. They had also
men armed with clubs, others with battle-axes and
javelins.</p>

<p>The feudal troops established by William the
Conqueror consisted (as already stated in the Introduction
to the Cavalry) almost entirely of horse;
but when the warlike barons and knights, with their
trains of tenants and vassals, took the field, a proportion
of men appeared on foot, and, although
these were of inferior degree, they proved stout-hearted
Britons of stanch fidelity. When stipendiary
troops were employed, infantry always constituted
a considerable portion of the military force;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
and this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arme</i> has since acquired, in every quarter
of the globe, a celebrity never exceeded by the
armies of any nation at any period.</p>

<p>The weapons carried by the infantry, during the
several reigns succeeding the Conquest, were bows
and arrows, half-pikes, lances, halberds, various
kinds of battle-axes, swords, and daggers. Armour
was worn on the head and body, and in course of
time the practice became general for military men
to be so completely cased in steel, that it was
almost impossible to slay them.</p>

<p>The introduction of the use of gunpowder in the
destructive purposes of war, in the early part of the
fourteenth century, produced a change in the arms
and equipment of the infantry-soldier. Bows and
arrows gave place to various kinds of fire-arms, but
British archers continued formidable adversaries;
and, owing to the inconvenient construction and imperfect
bore of the fire-arms when first introduced,
a body of men, well trained in the use of the bow
from their youth, was considered a valuable acquisition
to every army, even as late as the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>During a great part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth
each company of infantry usually consisted of
men armed five different ways; in every hundred
men forty were "<em>men-at-arms</em>," and sixty "<em>shot</em>;"
the "men-at-arms" were ten halberdiers, or battle-axe
men, and thirty pikemen; and the "shot" were
twenty archers, twenty musketeers, and twenty
harquebusiers, and each man carried, besides his
principal weapon, a sword and dagger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span></p>

<p>Companies of infantry varied at this period in
numbers from 150 to 300 men; each company had
a colour or ensign, and the mode of formation recommended
by an English military writer (Sir John
Smithe) in 1590 was:&mdash;the colour in the centre of
the company guarded by the halberdiers; the pikemen
in equal proportions, on each flank of the
halberdiers: half the musketeers on each flank of
the pikes; half the archers on each flank of the musketeers,
and the harquebusiers (whose arms were
much lighter than the muskets then in use) in equal
proportions on each flank of the company for skirmishing.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
It was customary to unite a number of companies
into one body, called a <span class="smcap">Regiment</span>, which
frequently amounted to three thousand men: but
each company continued to carry a colour. Numerous
improvements were eventually introduced in the
construction of fire-arms, and, it having been found
impossible to make armour proof against the muskets
then in use (which carried a very heavy ball) without
its being too weighty for the soldier, armour was
gradually laid aside by the infantry in the seventeenth
century: bows and arrows also fell into disuse,
and the infantry were reduced to two classes,
viz.: <em>musketeers</em>, armed with matchlock muskets,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>swords, and daggers; and <em>pikemen</em>, armed with pikes
from fourteen to eighteen feet long, and swords.</p>

<p>In the early part of the seventeenth century
Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, reduced the
strength of regiments to 1000 men. He caused the
gunpowder, which had heretofore been carried in
flasks, or in small wooden bandoliers, each containing
a charge, to be made up into cartridges, and
carried in pouches; and he formed each regiment
into two wings of musketeers, and a centre division
of pikemen. He also adopted the practice of forming
four regiments into a brigade; and the number
of colours was afterwards reduced to three in each
regiment. He formed his columns so compactly that
his infantry could resist the charge of the celebrated
Polish horsemen and Austrian cuirassiers; and his
armies became the admiration of other nations. His
mode of formation was copied by the English,
French, and other European states; but so great
was the prejudice in favour of ancient customs, that
all his improvements were not adopted until near a
century afterwards.</p>

<p>In 1664 King Charles II. raised a corps for sea-service,
styled the Admiral's regiment. In 1678
each company of 100 men usually consisted of 30
pikemen, 60 musketeers, and 10 men armed with
light firelocks. In this year the King added a company
of men armed with hand grenades to each of
the old British regiments, which was designated the
"grenadier company." Daggers were so contrived
as to fit in the muzzles of the muskets, and bayonets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
similar to those at present in use, were adopted about
twenty years afterwards.</p>

<p>An Ordnance regiment was raised in 1685, by
order of King James II., to guard the artillery, and
was designated the Royal Fusiliers (now 7th Foot).
This corps, and the companies of grenadiers, did
not carry pikes.</p>

<p>King William III. incorporated the Admiral's
regiment in the second Foot Guards, and raised
two Marine regiments for sea-service. During the
war in this reign, each company of infantry (excepting
the fusiliers and grenadiers) consisted of 14
pikemen and 46 musketeers; the captains carried
pikes; lieutenants, partisans; ensigns, half-pikes;
and serjeants, halberds. After the peace in 1697 the
Marine regiments were disbanded, but were again
formed on the breaking out of the war in 1702.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>During the reign of Queen Anne the pikes were
laid aside, and every infantry soldier was armed
with a musket, bayonet, and sword; the grenadiers
ceased, about the same period, to carry hand grenades;
and the regiments were directed to lay aside
their third colour: the corps of Royal Artillery was
first added to the Army in this reign.</p>

<p>About the year 1745, the men of the battalion
companies of infantry ceased to carry swords; during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>the reign of George II. light companies were added
to infantry regiments; and in 1764 a Board of
General Officers recommended that the grenadiers
should lay aside their swords, as that weapon had
never been used during the Seven Years' War. Since
that period the arms of the infantry soldier have been
limited to the musket and bayonet.</p>

<p>The arms and equipment of the British Troops have
seldom differed materially, since the Conquest, from
those of other European states; and in some respects
the arming has, at certain periods, been allowed to
be inferior to that of the nations with whom they
have had to contend; yet, under this disadvantage,
the bravery and superiority of the British infantry
have been evinced on very many and most trying
occasions, and splendid victories have been gained
over very superior numbers.</p>

<p>Great Britain has produced a race of lion-like
champions who have dared to confront a host of
foes, and have proved themselves valiant with any
arms. At <em>Crecy</em>, King Edward III., at the head of
about 30,000 men, defeated, on the 26th of August,
1346, Philip King of France, whose army is said to
have amounted to 100,000 men; here British valour
encountered veterans of renown:&mdash;the King of Bohemia,
the King of Majorca, and many princes and
nobles were slain, and the French army was routed
and cut to pieces. Ten years afterwards, Edward
Prince of Wales, who was designated the Black
Prince, defeated, at <em>Poictiers</em>, with 14,000 men,
a French army of 60,000 horse, besides infantry,
and took John I., King of France, and his son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
Philip, prisoners. On the 25th of October, 1415,
King Henry V., with an army of about 13,000
men, although greatly exhausted by marches, privations,
and sickness, defeated, at <em>Agincourt</em>, the
Constable of France, at the head of the flower of
the French nobility and an army said to amount to
60,000 men, and gained a complete victory.</p>

<p>During the seventy years' war between the United
Provinces of the Netherlands and the Spanish monarchy,
which commenced in 1578 and terminated
in 1648, the British infantry in the service of the
States-General were celebrated for their unconquerable
spirit and firmness;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and in the thirty
years' war between the Protestant Princes and the
Emperor of Germany, the British Troops in the service
of Sweden and other states were celebrated for
deeds of heroism.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In the wars of Queen Anne,
the fame of the British army under the great
<span class="smcap">Marlborough</span> was spread throughout the world;
and if we glance at the achievements performed
within the memory of persons now living, there is
abundant proof that the Britons of the present age
are not inferior to their ancestors in the qualities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
which constitute good soldiers. Witness the deeds
of the brave men, of whom there are many now
surviving, who fought in Egypt in 1801, under the
brave Abercromby, and compelled the French army,
which had been vainly styled <em>Invincible</em>, to evacuate
that country; also the services of the gallant
Troops during the arduous campaigns in the Peninsula,
under the immortal <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>; and the
determined stand made by the British Army at
Waterloo, where Napoleon Bonaparte, who had
long been the inveterate enemy of Great Britain,
and had sought and planned her destruction by
every means he could devise, was compelled to
leave his vanquished legions to their fate, and to
place himself at the disposal of the British Government.
These achievements, with others of recent
dates, in the distant climes of India, prove that the
same valour and constancy which glowed in the
breasts of the heroes of Crecy, Poictiers, Agincourt,
Blenheim, and Ramilies, continue to animate the
Britons of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The British Soldier is distinguished for a robust
and muscular frame,&mdash;intrepidity which no danger
can appal,&mdash;unconquerable spirit and resolution,&mdash;patience
in fatigue and privation, and cheerful obedience
to his superiors. These qualities, united with
an excellent system of order and discipline to regulate
and give a skilful direction to the energies and
adventurous spirit of the hero, and a wise selection
of officers of superior talent to command, whose
presence inspires confidence,&mdash;have been the leading
causes of the splendid victories gained by the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
arms.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The fame of the deeds of the past and
present generations in the various battle-fields where
the robust sons of Albion have fought and conquered,
surrounds the British arms with a halo of glory;
these achievements will live in the page of history to
the end of time.</p>

<p>The records of the several regiments will be found
to contain a detail of facts of an interesting character,
connected with the hardships, sufferings, and gallant
exploits of British soldiers in the various parts of the
world where the calls of their Country and the commands
of their Sovereign have required them to
proceed in the execution of their duty, whether in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>active continental operations, or in maintaining colonial
territories in distant and unfavourable climes.</p>

<p>The superiority of the British infantry has been
pre-eminently set forth in the wars of six centuries,
and admitted by the greatest commanders which
Europe has produced. The formations and movements
of this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arme</i>, as at present practised, while
they are adapted to every species of warfare, and to
all probable situations and circumstances of service,
are calculated to show forth the brilliancy of military
tactics calculated upon mathematical and scientific
principles. Although the movements and evolutions
have been copied from the continental armies, yet
various improvements have from time to time been
introduced, to insure that simplicity and celerity by
which the superiority of the national military character
is maintained. The rank and influence which
Great Britain has attained among the nations of the
world, have in a great measure been purchased by
the valour of the Army, and to persons who have the
welfare of their country at heart, the records of the
several regiments cannot fail to prove interesting.</p>

Orders in 1801.</em>
</p>
<p>
In the General Orders issued by Lieut.-General Sir John Hope (afterwards
Lord Hopetoun), congratulating the army upon the successful result
of the Battle of Corunna, on the 16th of January, 1809, it is stated:&mdash;"On
no occasion has the undaunted valour of British troops ever been more
manifest. At the termination of a severe and harassing march, rendered
necessary by the superiority which the enemy had acquired, and
which had materially impaired the efficiency of the troops, many disadvantages
were to be encountered. These have all been surmounted by
the conduct of the troops themselves: and the enemy has been taught,
that whatever advantages of position or of numbers he may possess, there
is inherent in the British officers and soldiers a bravery that knows not
how to yield,&mdash;that no circumstances can appal,&mdash;and that will ensure
victory, when it is to be obtained by the exertion of any human means."</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">1678</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The Royal North British Regiment of Fusiliers</span>
derives its origin from the commotions in Scotland,
during the reign of King Charles II., who attempted
to establish Episcopacy in that country; but was opposed
by the Presbyterians, who wished to adhere to their
religious institutions, and prosecutions being used in
Scotland by the Government, to enforce obedience,
collisions occurred between the inhabitants and the
military, which were sometimes attended with loss of
life. Several Highland clans were called out, in 1678,
and quartered upon the Presbyterians, and in the
autumn of the same year a regiment of foot was added
to the military establishment of Scotland, of which
Charles, Earl of Mar, was appointed Colonel, by commission
dated the 23rd of September, 1678: this corps,
having been retained in the service, now bears the
title of the <span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST</span> Regiment of Foot, or the
<span class="fs80">ROYAL NORTH BRITISH FUSILIERS</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Regiments of infantry, at this period, were generally
armed with pikes and muskets; but the practice was introduced
of arming every man, of a few select corps, with
a fusil, or a light musket, and these regiments were
called <span class="fs80">FUSILIERS</span>. The <span class="smcap">Earl of Mar's</span> regiment was
one of the first corps which obtained this distinction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1679<br />1680</div>

<p>In the following year, Archbishop Sharp, who had
become particularly obnoxious to the non-conformists,
was murdered. This event was followed by severities
against the Presbyterians, and a meeting for public
worship, at Loudon-hill, having been attacked by a
body of horse and dragoons, under Captain Robert
Graham, of Claverhouse, afterwards Viscount Dundee,
the countrymen, being numerous, and provided with
arms, gained some advantage over the military. The
persons, who had thus committed themselves, resolved
to keep together in arms, and to seek by their valour,
that redress to which they considered themselves
entitled. They were soon augmented in numbers, and
taking post behind the river Clyde, they barricaded
<em>Bothwell Bridge</em>. The <span class="smcap">Earl of Mar's</span> regiment was
called upon to take the field against the insurgents, and
it formed part of the army, commanded by James, Duke
of Monmouth, which attacked the rebels on the 22nd
of June, and gained a decisive victory. The rebels made
a feeble resistance on this occasion; twelve hundred foot
laid down their arms without striking a blow, and the
other divisions of their army fled in dismay; about four
hundred were killed by the King's troops in the pursuit,
and the rebellion was suppressed. Several parties, however,
kept together in arms for some time, and gave the
military much trouble in that and the following year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1685</div>

<p>In the early part of 1685, King Charles II. died, and
was succeeded by his brother, King James the Second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
of England, and Seventh of Scotland. The King being
a Roman Catholic, some disaffected persons supposed
the people would not submit to his government; and
the Earl of Argyle and the Duke of Monmouth, who
were both in exile on the Continent, for their political
conduct, agreed to raise the standard of rebellion,&mdash;the
former in Scotland, and the latter in England. The
Earl of Argyle landed in Argyleshire in May, and
assembled a body of men; when the <span class="smcap">Earl of Mar's</span>
regiment was again called into the field. The King's
troops were commanded by the Earl of Dumbarton;
and on the night of the 19th of June, the two armies
encamped in sight of each other. The rebels attempted
to avoid an engagement, by a night march; but they
were led into a bog in the dark; alarm and disorder
followed; and the insurgents, proceeding some in one
direction and some in another, left the Earl of Argyle
without an army; he was captured and executed.
The Duke of Monmouth met with a similar fate, and the
rebellion in England was suppressed without the <span class="smcap">Earl
of Mar's</span> regiment being required to pass the border.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1686</div>

<p>The Earl of Mar was succeeded in the colonelcy of
the regiment, in 1686, by Colonel Thomas Buchan,
from a regiment of horse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1688</div>

<p>When the attempts made by King James to establish
papacy and arbitrary government had alarmed his
subjects, and the Prince of Orange was preparing an
armament for the invasion of England, the regiment was
one of the corps which marched from Scotland to support
the authority of the King; and in the early part of
November, 1688, it arrived in the vicinity of London,
when it was ordered to occupy quarters in Spitalfields
and the Tower Hamlets. The Prince of Orange landed
on the 5th of November; King James discovered that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
he had alienated the affections of his subjects, both
civil and military, and he fled to France. Colonel
<span class="smcap">Buchan's</span> regiment was ordered, by the Prince of
Orange, to occupy quarters at Witney, in Oxfordshire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1689</div>

<p>The Prince and Princess of Orange were elevated to the
Throne by the titles of King William and Queen Mary;
and Colonel Buchan having adhered to the interests
of King James, King William conferred the colonelcy
of the regiment on Colonel Francis Fergus O'Farrell, by
commission dated the 1st of March, 1689.</p>

<p>From Oxfordshire, the regiment marched to
Gravesend, where it embarked for Holland, and
joining the Dutch army commanded by Prince
Waldeck, served the campaign of that year with the
division under the Earl (afterwards Duke) of
Marlborough. The regiment took part in a sharp
action with the French troops, commanded by Marshal
d'Humières, at <em>Walcourt</em>, in the province of Namur,
on the 25th of August, on which occasion the French
were repulsed in their attacks on the allied army, with
considerable loss.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1690</div>

<p>The regiment passed the winter in Flanders, and in
the summer of 1690 again took the field; it was on its
march for Brussels on the 21st of June, in order to join
the allied army; but Prince Waldeck engaged the
French at Fleurus, without waiting for the arrival of the
British troops, and was defeated. This disaster occasioned
the services of the army to be limited to defensive
operations during the remainder of the campaign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1691</div>

<p>In March, 1691, the regiment was encamped at
Halle, in South Brabant, and formed in brigade with
the second battalion of the Royals; the French besieged
Mons, and the allies were too few in numbers to prevent
the capture of the place by the enemy. After the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
surrender of Mons, the regiment was placed in quarters
until May, when it encamped near Brussels, and was
formed in brigade with the Royals, and the Scots
regiments of Mackay, Ramsay, and Angus, under the
orders of Brigadier-General Ramsay.</p>

<p>In a list of the army in Flanders, printed in July,
1691, the regiment is styled "<span class="smcap">O'Farrell's fusiliers</span>;"
and its uniform is stated to be <em>red, faced and lined with
the same colour</em>.</p>

<p>At the termination of the campaign, the regiment was
again placed in winter-quarters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1692</div>

<p>A numerous French army appeared in the Netherlands
in the spring of 1692, and besieged Namur;
when <span class="smcap">O'Farrell's fusiliers</span> were called from their
quarters, and advanced with the army, commanded by
King William III., to the relief of the place; but the
march having been delayed by heavy rains, the garrison
surrendered on the 20th of June. A few days afterwards,
a detachment of the regiment was employed in
an attempt to surprise Mons; but the garrison was
found prepared. On this occasion, Colonel Sir Robert
Douglas and Colonel O'Farrell, having proceeded a
short distance to consult with the Prince of Wirtemberg,
who commanded the party, mistook their way in the
dark, and were made prisoners by a detachment of
French cavalry: they were released on paying the
regulated ransom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O'Farrell's fusiliers</span> formed part of the advance-guard
at the battle of <em>Steenkirk</em> on the 3rd of August;
and were severely engaged with the superior numbers
of the enemy under the Duke of Luxembourg. The
regiment distinguished itself on this occasion, and sustained
the loss of many brave officers and soldiers.
D'Auvergne states, in his history of this campaign,&mdash;"Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
van-guard behaved in this engagement to such
wonder and admiration, that though they received the
charge of several battalions of the enemy, one after
another, yet they made them retreat almost to their
camp." The corps in advance were not supported in
time to enable them to persevere in their career of
victory; and King William commanded the army to
retreat.</p>

<p>The regiment had Major Keith, Captains White,
Cygnoe, Mackenzie, and Sharp, Lieutenants Charles
King and Edward Griffith killed; and Lieutenant Newton
wounded. The regiment was not engaged in any
service of importance during the remainder of the
campaign, and it passed the winter at Ghent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1693</div>

<p>Again taking the field in the summer of 1693, the
<span class="fs80">NORTH BRITISH FUSILIERS</span> were formed in brigade with the
regiments of Leven (twenty-fifth), Monro (twenty-sixth),
Mackay, and Lander (afterwards disbanded), under
the command of Brigadier-General Ramsay, and, after
taking part in several manœuvres, were engaged at the
battle of <em>Landen</em> on the 29th of July. At sunrise on
the morning of that day, a French force of very superior
numbers, commanded by the Duke of Luxembourg,
appeared before the position occupied by the confederate
army under King William III., when the <span class="fs80">NORTH
BRITISH FUSILIERS</span>, and other regiments of their brigade,
were ordered to occupy some hedges and narrow roads,
beyond the village of Laer, on the right of the line.
This village, and the ground occupied by General
Ramsay's brigade, being attacked by a numerous body
of the enemy, the <span class="fs80">NORTH BRITISH FUSILIERS</span> were engaged
in a sharp musketry battle in the fields and open
grounds. At length the Third foot, and other corps in
the village of Laer, were forced to retire; but they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
rallied, and, being joined by Brigadier-General Ramsay's
brigade, the whole charged, and by a gallant effort recaptured
the village; the <span class="fs80">NORTH BRITISH FUSILIERS</span> distinguished
themselves on the occasion. The French afterwards
carried the village of Neer-Winden, and forced the
position; the regiments at Laer then became separated
from the main body of the confederate army; they
gallantly defended their post some time, and eventually
retired, fighting, to the Gheet, forded that river, and
joined several corps which had crossed the bridge of
Neer-Hespen. The army was retreating, and the <span class="fs80">NORTH
BRITISH FUSILIERS</span> accompanied King William to the
vicinity of Tirlemont. The regiment had Captains
Campbell and Strayton, Lieutenants Douglas and Dunbar,
and Adjutant Walle wounded; Captain Paterson
taken prisoner; also a number of soldiers killed,
wounded, and prisoners.</p>

<p>At the end of the campaign, the regiment was placed
in garrison at Bruges.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1694</div>

<p>During the summer of 1694, the regiment performed
many long marches in Brabant and Flanders; but was
not engaged with the enemy, and in the autumn it
marched to Deinse.</p>

<p>This year the King commanded a board of General
Officers to assemble and decide upon the rank of the
several corps of the army. This board gave precedence
to the English regiments, and gave the Scots and Irish
regiments rank in the English army from the date of
their first arrival in England, or from the date when
they were first placed on the English establishment.
The <span class="fs80">NORTH BRITISH FUSILIERS</span>, not having entered
England until the Revolution in 1688, received rank as
<span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST</span> regiment. Numerical titles were not
generally used until the reign of King George II.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1695</div>

<p>When the army took the field to serve the campaign
of 1695, the <span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST</span> were left in garrison at
Deinse, where some stores of provision were formed.
King William undertook the siege of Namur, and the
regiment was directed to join the covering army under
the Prince of Vaudemont; but it subsequently returned
to Deinse, of which place its colonel, Brigadier-General
O'Farrell, was commandant.</p>

<p>The French commander, Marshal Villeroy, detached
a strong body of troops, under the Marquis of Feuqueres,
to reduce the town of <em>Deinse</em> where the <span class="fs80">NORTH BRITISH
FUSILIERS</span> were stationed. This town was situate on the
river Lys; it was only slightly fortified, and in many
places there was only an entrenchment and some palisades
as defensive works; eight pieces of cannon were
the only ordnance in the town. Under these circumstances
Brigadier-General O'Farrell considered it impossible
to make a successful defence of the place, and
he surrendered on the 21st of July without having
fired a shot. The <span class="fs80">FUSILIERS</span> became prisoners of war
on this occasion.</p>

<p>Brigadier-General O'Farrell was afterwards tried
by a general court-martial, and cashiered: and King
William conferred the colonelcy of the regiment on
Colonel Robert Mackay, from a Scots corps, which was
afterwards disbanded.</p>

<p>After the surrender of Namur, the regiment rejoined
the allied army, and was again stationed at Bruges.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1696</div>

<p>From Bruges the regiment proceeded to the camp at
Marykirk, and it served the campaign of 1696 with the
army of Brabant: in the autumn it went into village
cantonments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1697</div>

<p>In December, Colonel Robert Mackay died; and on
the 1st of January, 1697, King William conferred the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
colonelcy of the regiment on Lieut.-Colonel Archibald
Row, from the Sixteenth foot.</p>

<p>Quitting its village quarters on the 13th of March,
1697, the regiment entered upon the operations of
another campaign. While the troops were in the field,
negotiations for a general peace commenced at Ryswick,
and the treaty was signed in September. Thus the
British monarch witnessed his efforts for the liberties of
Europe, and for the preservation of the balance of power
in Christendom, attended with success.</p>

<p>The regiment returned to Scotland during the winter,
and was stationed there during the remainder of King
William's reign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1702</div>

<p>Queen Anne succeeded to the throne on the 8th of
March, 1702; and the French monarch, having violated
the conditions of existing treaties, by procuring the
accession of his grandson, Philip, Duke of Anjou, to the
throne of Spain, war was declared against France soon
afterwards. At the commencement of hostilities the
<span class="fs80">NORTH BRITISH FUSILIERS</span> were selected to proceed on
foreign service, and they embarked from Scotland for
Holland, to serve with the allied army commanded by
the Earl of Marlborough. The regiment did not join
the army immediately on its arrival in Holland, but was
stationed some time at Breda, and in September it
marched towards Flanders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1703</div>

<p>Quitting its winter-quarters in April, 1703, the regiment
marched towards Maestricht, where the allied
army was assembled, and the second battalion of the
Royals, with the Tenth, Sixteenth, <span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST</span>, and
Twenty-Sixth regiments, were formed in brigade, under
Brigadier-General the Earl of Derby.</p>

<p>The regiment took part in the operations of the
campaign, and its services were connected with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
reduction of <em>Huy</em>, a strong fortress on the Maese, above
the city of Liege, which was besieged and captured in
ten days. The regiment was afterwards detached from
the main army, to take part in the capture of <em>Limburg</em>,
a city of the Spanish Netherlands, situate on a pleasant
eminence near the banks of the Wesdet. The siege of
this place was commenced on the 10th of September, and
the <span class="fs80">NORTH BRITISH FUSILIERS</span> were employed in carrying
on the approaches, and in making the attacks; and
in seventeen days the garrison surrendered at discretion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1704</div>

<p>In October the regiment marched back to Holland,
where it was stationed during the winter.</p>

<p>From Holland the regiment marched, in the months
of May and June, 1704, to the interior of Germany, to
arrest the progress of the French and Bavarians, who
had gained considerable advantage over the Imperialists.
A junction was formed with the Germans under the
Margrave of Baden; and on the 2nd of July the <span class="fs80">NORTH
BRITISH FUSILIERS</span> took part in the attack of the enemy's
position on the lofty heights of <em>Schellenberg</em> on the north
bank of the Danube; when the entrenchments were
carried, and the French and Bavarians, commanded by
the Count d'Arco, were driven from their post with
severe loss.</p>

<p>The regiment had a few private soldiers killed and
wounded; also Captain Kygoe, Lieutenants Johnston
and John Campbell, wounded.</p>

<p>After this victory the regiment penetrated the Electorate
of Bavaria to the vicinity of the enemy's fortified camp
at Augsburg, which was found too strong to be attacked
with any prospect of success, and the army retired a
few stages to undertake the siege of Ingoldstadt. At
the same time a numerous reinforcement of French
troops arrived at the theatre of war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>These events were followed by the battle of <em>Blenheim</em>,
on the 13th of August, when the French and Bavarians,
commanded by Marshal Tallard and the Elector of
Bavaria, were overpowered by the allies under the Duke
of Marlborough and Prince Eugene of Savoy, and a
victory was gained which reflected lustre on the British
arms. The <span class="fs80">NORTH BRITISH FUSILIERS</span> were selected to
lead the attack against the French troops in the village
of <span class="smcap">Blenheim</span>, and their colonel, Brigadier-General Row,
placed himself at the head of his regiment, which was
followed by four other corps. In the Annals of Queen
Anne it is stated&mdash;"The five English battalions, led on
by Brigadier-General Row, who charged on foot at the
head of his own regiment with unparalleled intrepidity,
assaulted the village of Blenheim, advancing to the
very muzzles of the enemy's muskets, and some of the
officers exchanged thrusts of swords through the
palisades;"&mdash;but the avenues of the village were found
strongly fortified, and defended by a force of superior
numbers. Brigadier-General Row led the <span class="fs80">NORTH BRITISH
FUSILIERS</span> up to the palisades before he gave the word
"fire," and the next moment he fell mortally wounded;
Lieut.-Colonel Dalyel and Major Campbell, being both
on the spot, stepped forward to raise their colonel, and
were both instantly pierced by musket-balls; the soldiers,
exasperated at seeing the three field officers of the regiment
fall, made a gallant effort to force their way into
the village, but this was found impossible, and the regiment
was ordered to retire. The moment the soldiers
faced about, thirteen squadrons of French cavalry galloped
forward to charge them, and one of the colours
of the regiment was captured by the enemy; but the
French horsemen were repulsed by the fire of a brigade
of Hessians, and the colour was recovered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Another attempt to capture the village of Blenheim
having failed, the firing was continued against this post,
and the army advanced against the enemy's line, which
was driven from the field with great slaughter, and
the loss of its cannon, and of many officers and soldiers
made prisoners, among whom was the French commander,
Marshal Tallard. Additional forces were then
brought against the French troops in Blenheim, and
they surrendered prisoners of war. The Germans, who
attacked the enemy's right, were also victorious; and
the gallant achievements of the allied army raised on
the banks of the Danube a trophy which time cannot
destroy.</p>

<p>The regiment had Lieut.-Colonel Dalyel, Captain
Stratton, jun., Captain Stratton, senior, Lieutenants
Vandergracht, Hill, Campbell, and Travallion killed;
Brigadier-General Row and Major Campbell died of
their wounds; Captains Craufurd and Fairlee, Lieutenants
Dunbar, J. Douglas, Elliott, Ogilvy, Maxwell,
Stuart, Primrose, and Gordon wounded.</p>

<p>The number of the enemy captured on this occasion
was so great, that the <span class="fs80">NORTH BRITISH FUSILIERS</span>, and four
other corps, were sent to Holland in charge of prisoners.
These corps marched in charge of the captured French
and Bavarians to Mentz, where they embarked in boats
and sailed to Holland, under the orders of Brigadier-General
Fergusson; and having delivered them into the
charge of other regiments, went into quarters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1705</div>

<p>The colonelcy of the regiment was conferred on John,
Viscount Mordaunt, who had distinguished himself at
the head of the foot guards which commenced the attack
on the heights of Schellenberg. A number of
recruits from Scotland having replaced the losses of the
preceding campaign, the regiment appeared complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
and in good order when it took the field to serve the
campaign of 1705. It was employed in the expedition
up the Moselle: and returning to the Netherlands, was
afterwards engaged at the forcing of the French lines at
<em>Helixem</em> and <em>Neer Hespen</em>, on the morning of the 18th
of July, when the superior tactics of the British Commander,
and the gallantry of his troops, were very
conspicuous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1706</div>

<p>The regiment had also the honor to take part in
gaining another splendid victory over the combined
French, Spanish, and Bavarian forces, at <em>Ramilies</em>, on
Whit-Sunday, the 23rd of May, 1706. During the
early part of the action the <span class="fs80">NORTH BRITISH FUSILIERS</span>,
the Third foot, and three regiments of cavalry, were
stationed on the heights of Foulz, where they had a view
of the field of battle. An important crisis in the battle
arriving, these corps descended from the heights,&mdash;the
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'FUSILEERS and Third'"><span class="fs80">FUSILIERS</span> and Third</ins> Foot forced their way through a
morass, crossed the Little Gheet, ascended the acclivity
between that river and the Jauche, and charging the
enemy's left flank, forced three French regiments into
some low grounds, where the greater part of them
were either killed or taken prisoners. The allies were
successful at every part of the field, and the legions of
the enemy were overpowered, and pursued from the
plains of Ramilies with great slaughter until the following
morning, by which time nearly all the enemy's
cannon, with many standards, colours, and kettle-drums,
had been captured.</p>

<p>This victory augmented the reputation of the British
arms; and was followed by very important results.
Spanish Brabant, and many of the principal towns of
Flanders, were rescued from the power of the enemy.
The services of the regiment are connected with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
capture of Ostend, Menin, and Aeth; and it passed the
winter in garrison in Flanders.</p>

<p>In June of this year Viscount Mordaunt exchanged
with Colonel Sampson de Lalo, a French gentleman of
the Protestant religion, who had been forced to quit his
native country by the Edict of Nantes; Colonel de Lalo
had served as Lieut.-Colonel and Colonel of the Twenty-eighth
regiment several years, and had the reputation of
being an excellent officer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1707</div>

<p>During the campaign of 1707, the services of the
regiment were limited to marches and occupying positions;
and it passed the winter in West Flanders.</p>

<p>The Union of Scotland and England took place this
year, which occasioned St. George's cross to be added
to the colours of the Scots regiments, and St. Andrew's
cross to the colours of the English regiments. The
corps, previously designated <em>Scots</em> regiments, took the
title of <em>North British</em> regiments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1708</div>

<p>In May, 1708, the regiment again took the field, and
on the 11th of July it had an opportunity of acquiring
fresh laurels at the battle of <em>Oudenarde</em>, which was
fought in the broken grounds near the river Scheldt.
On this occasion the regiment was engaged in a severe
musketry action, and it succeeded in driving the French
corps opposed to it from field to field, until the darkness
of the night put an end to the conflict. Before the following
morning the wreck of the French army had retreated
in disorder towards Ghent.</p>

<p>After this victory, the siege of <em>Lisle</em>, the capital of
French Flanders, was resolved upon. This fortress was
deemed almost impregnable; it was garrisoned by
fifteen thousand men, commanded by Marshal Boufflers,
who resolved upon making a desperate defence. The
<span class="fs80">NORTH BRITISH FUSILIERS</span> were selected to take part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
in the attack of this important fortress, under the orders
of Prince Eugene of Savoy; the covering army was
commanded by the Duke of Marlborough. The
regiment had several men killed and wounded in
carrying on the approaches, and at the attack of the
counterscarp it had thirteen men killed; three officers,
four serjeants, and sixty-six rank and file wounded.
The progress of this siege was a subject of peculiar
interest throughout Europe; and the besieging army
witnessed its extraordinary efforts for the capture of the
place, attended by complete success, on the 9th of
December, when the citadel surrendered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1709</div>

<p>Having reposed a few months in quarters, and received
a body of fine recruits from Scotland, the regiment joined
the army, and was employed in covering the siege of
<em>Tournay</em>, in July and August, 1709. The citadel of Tournay
surrendered in the beginning of September, and the
army afterwards marched in the direction of Mons.</p>

<p>A numerous French army, commanded by Marshals
Villars and Boufflers, took up a position at <em>Malplaquet</em>,
and strengthened the post by entrenchments and other
works of art. The Duke of Marlborough and Prince
Eugene had confidence in the valour and perseverance
of the troops under their orders, and they attacked the
enemy's formidable position on the 11th of September,
on which occasion the heroic valour of the troops was
conspicuous; the enemy's entrenchments and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">abatis-de-bois</i>
were stormed with distinguished gallantry, the determined
resistance of the French was overcome, and another
trophy was acquired; but with the loss of many brave officers
and soldiers, including the Colonel of the <span class="fs80">NORTH
BRITISH FUSILIERS</span>, Brigadier-General <span class="smcap">de Lalo</span>, who
was killed at the head of a brigade, and his fall was much
regretted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>In addition to the loss of its Colonel, the regiment
had also Captains Monroe, Wemys, and Farley killed;
Captains Montressor and Lowther wounded.</p>

<p>After the death of Brigadier-General de Lalo,
Viscount Mordaunt was re-appointed on the 4th of
September to the colonelcy of the <span class="fs80">NORTH BRITISH FUSILIERS</span>,
from the Twenty-eighth regiment.</p>

<p>The regiment was afterwards employed in covering
the siege of <em>Mons</em>, which was terminated by the surrender
of the garrison on the 20th of October; when
the regiment marched into quarters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1710</div>

<p>On the 14th of April, 1710, the regiment marched
out of its winter-quarters towards the frontiers of
France, and was engaged in the movements by which
the French lines were passed at <em>Pont-à-Vendin</em>: it was
afterwards selected to take part in the siege of <em>Douay</em>,
where it performed much severe service. It was
employed in carrying on the approaches, in storming
the outworks, and other duties connected with the
siege, and sustained considerable loss in killed and
wounded. The garrison beat a parley on the 25th of
June, and afterwards surrendered the fortress.</p>

<p>After the capture of Douay, the regiment was employed
in covering the siege of <em>Bethune</em>, which place was surrendered
in August. The regiment was also with the
covering army during the sieges of <em>St. Venant</em> and <em>Aire</em>;
the former place surrendered on the 30th of September,
and the latter on the 9th of November.</p>

<p>Viscount Mordaunt died this year, and was succeeded
in the colonelcy by Major-General Meredith, from the
Thirty-seventh regiment. This officer was succeeded,
in December, by Major-General the Earl of Orrery,
from a newly-raised regiment, which was afterwards
disbanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1711</div>

<p>After passing the winter in quarters at Dendermond,
the regiment joined the army in May, 1711, and it took
part in the movements by which the boasted impregnable
French lines were passed at <em>Arleux</em> on the 5th of
August. The regiment was afterwards employed in the
siege of <em>Bouchain</em>, in which service obstacles of the
greatest magnitude had to be overcome, and the abilities
of the commanders, with the valour of the troops, were
put to a severe test. These qualities were found in the
besieging army; on more than one occasion the soldiers
fought up to their middle in water, and by a gallant
perseverance, which reflected honor on all the corps
engaged in the siege, every difficulty was overcome;
and the garrison surrendered on the 13th of September.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1712</div>

<p>The regiment joined the army commanded by the Duke
of Ormond, in the campaign of 1712, and advanced to
the frontiers of Picardy; but a suspension of hostilities
was soon afterwards proclaimed, preparatory to a general
peace, when the British army marched to Ghent, and
afterwards went into quarters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1713</div>

<p>A treaty of peace was concluded at Utrecht, and the
soldiers of the <span class="fs80">NORTH BRITISH FUSILIERS</span> could look
back with exultation at the career of victory and honor
which had attended their corps during these memorable
campaigns. At this period the regiment is designated
by historians, and in official documents, by the title of
the <span class="fs80">ROYAL NORTH BRITISH FUSILIERS</span>; but the date
when this honorary distinction of "<span class="fs80">ROYAL</span>" was conferred
upon it, has not been ascertained.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1714</div>

<p>The <span class="fs80">ROYAL NORTH BRITISH FUSILIERS</span> were stationed
in Flanders until the decease of Queen Anne, on the 1st
of August, 1714, and the accession of King George I.,
when they were ordered to embark for England. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
landed at Gravesend on the 23rd of August, and were
afterwards directed to march to Scotland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1715</div>

<p>In 1715 the Earl of Mar<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> erected the standard of
rebellion in Scotland, and summoned the Highland clans
to aid him in establishing the Pretender on the throne.
The <span class="fs80">ROYAL NORTH BRITISH FUSILIERS</span> were encamped at
Stirling, under the command of the Duke of Argyle, and
advanced with the Royal army to <em>Dumblain</em>, to defeat the
attempts of the enemy to march southward. On the
morning of the 13th of November the two armies confronted
each other on <em>Sheriff-muir</em>. On the approach of
the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'clans,  was found'">clans, it was found</ins> necessary for the Royal forces to
change position, and this movement was executed at a
critical time with steadiness; but several corps were
suddenly attacked by the clans while in the act of forming,
and suffered severely. The left wing of the rebel
army was overpowered, and driven from the field with
great slaughter; and the left wing of the Royal army was
also forced to retire; thus each commander had one wing
victorious, and one wing defeated: the rebels were prevented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>marching southward, and retired; and the
King's troops returned to their camp at Stirling.</p>

<p>The regiment had one captain, two lieutenants, three
serjeants, and eighty-five rank and file killed; one
captain, one serjeant, and twenty-four rank and file
wounded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1716</div>

<p>Reinforcements having arrived, the King's troops
advanced, in January, 1716, to attack the insurgents,
who made a precipitate retreat. The Pretender, and
several leaders in the rebellion, escaped to the Continent,
and the clans separated. The rebellion was thus suppressed.</p>

<p>In July of this year the Earl of Orrery was succeeded
in the colonelcy of the regiment by Colonel George
Macartney, whose regiment of foot had been disbanded
at the peace of Utrecht.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1727</div>

<p>The regiment was employed on home service many
years; and in 1727 it was held in readiness to embark
for Holland, to aid the Dutch in their approaching war
with the Emperor of Germany; but the presence of
British troops was not required.</p>

<p>In the same year Colonel Macartney was removed to
the Seventh horse, now Sixth Dragoon Guards, and the
colonelcy of the <span class="fs80">ROYAL NORTH BRITISH FUSILIERS</span> was
conferred on Brigadier-General Sir James Wood, from
the Dutch service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1728<br />1729</div>

<p>The order for embarking for Holland having been countermanded,
the regiment afterwards proceeded to Ireland,
and was placed upon the establishment of that country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1738</div>

<p>Major-General Sir James Wood died in 1738, and
King George II. nominated Colonel John Campbell,
afterwards Duke of Argyle, to the colonelcy of the
<span class="fs80">ROYAL NORTH BRITISH FUSILIERS</span>, from the Thirty-ninth
regiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1739<br />1740<br />1741</div>

<p>War having been declared against Spain, in the
autumn of 1739, the regiment was withdrawn from
Ireland, and landing at Liverpool, was stationed in
South Britain during the year 1740; in the summer of
1741 it was encamped on Lexden Heath, where seven
regiments of cavalry and seven of infantry were assembled,
and held in readiness for foreign service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1742</div>

<p>In the summer of 1742 King George II. sent sixteen
thousand men to Flanders, to support the interest of the
House of Austria against the aggressions of France and
Bavaria: the <span class="fs80">ROYAL NORTH BRITISH FUSILIERS</span> formed
part of this force, and were stationed some time at Ghent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1743</div>

<p>Early in 1743 the regiment commenced its march for
Germany, and after taking part in several movements in
the field, had the honor to distinguish itself, under the
eye of its Sovereign, at the battle of <em>Dettingen</em>, on the
27th of June, when the French troops, under Marshal
Noailles, were driven from the field of battle with great
slaughter, and the loss of a number of standards and
colours.</p>

<p>The <span class="fs80">ROYAL NORTH BRITISH FUSILIERS</span> had Lieutenant
Yonge, one serjeant, and thirty-five rank and file killed;
Lieutenant Levingstone, one serjeant, two drummers,
and fifty-three rank and file wounded.</p>

<p>The regiment was afterwards encamped near Hanau;
in August it crossed the Rhine, and was employed in
West Germany; but in the autumn it returned to
Flanders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1744</div>

<p>During the campaign of 1744 the regiment served
with the army under Field-Marshal Wade; it was encamped
between Asche and Alost, afterwards on the
banks of the Scheldt, and subsequently penetrated the
French territory to the vicinity of Lisle; but returned to
Ghent for winter-quarters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1745</div>

<p>Quitting its cantonments in April, 1745, the regiment
marched, with the army commanded by His Royal
Highness the Duke of Cumberland, to the relief of
<em>Tournay</em>, which fortress was besieged by a numerous
French army, which took up a position near the village
of <em>Fontenoy</em>. The enemy had a great superiority of
numbers; but the Duke of Cumberland, trusting to the
innate bravery of his troops, resolved to hazard a general
engagement on the 11th of May, when the <span class="fs80">ROYAL NORTH
BRITISH FUSILIERS</span> had their valour and endurance put
to a severe test, and they proved themselves not unworthy
successors of the gallant officers and soldiers who
triumphed at <em>Blenheim</em> and <em>Ramilies</em> under the great
Duke of Marlborough.</p>

<p>Soon after nine o'clock the British infantry advanced
in the face of a heavy fire of grape and musketry, and
by a gallant charge broke through the French lines; but
the Dutch failed to carry the village of <em>Fontenoy</em>, and
a brigade under Brigadier-General Ingoldsby did not
capture the battery it was appointed to attack; the troops,
which had forced the enemy's centre, were thus exposed
to so severe a cross fire, that they were ordered to retire.
A second attack was made; British valour and
intrepidity were again triumphant; but the failure of
the Dutch a second time, produced disastrous results,
and the British regiments, which had carried the enemy's
entrenchments, and forced the centre, were nearly
annihilated by a destructive cross fire. The <span class="fs80">ROYAL NORTH
BRITISH FUSILIERS</span> suffered severely on this occasion.
The Duke of Cumberland afterwards ordered a retreat,
and the army withdrew from the field of battle to Aeth.</p>

<p>Lieutenants Campbell, Houston, and Serjeant, of the
regiment, were killed; Major Colville, Captains Latan,
Olivant, and Knatchbull, Lieutenants Maxwell, Colville,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Ballenden, Macgaken, and Townsend, wounded; Captain
Sandilands, Lieutenant Stuart, and Quarter-Master
Stewart prisoners; eleven serjeants and two hundred and
fifty-nine rank and file killed, wounded, and prisoners.</p>

<p>The severe loss which the regiment had experienced
occasioned it to be placed in garrison at <em>Ostend</em>. This
place was besieged by a numerous French force; and
the garrison defended their post some time; but the
works were not in repair, the stores were defective, and
the garrison not sufficiently numerous: under these circumstances
the governor surrendered, on condition that
the garrison should join the allied army.</p>

<p>While the regiment was in Flanders, Charles Edward,
eldest son of the Pretender, arrived in Scotland, and
being joined by a number of Highland clans, he made
a desperate attempt to overturn the existing government,
and establish his father's authority in the kingdom.
The <span class="fs80">ROYAL NORTH BRITISH FUSILIERS</span> were ordered to
return to England; they arrived in the river Thames on
the 4th of November, and after landing, marched northward:
the efficiency of the regiment was increased by a
body of fine recruits enlisted in Scotland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1746</div>

<p>The regiment arrived at Edinburgh in January, 1746,
and advanced with the army commanded by the Duke
of Cumberland, towards Stirling, when the young Pretender
raised the siege of Stirling castle and made a
precipitate retreat. The pursuit was retarded by severe
weather; but the army continued its advance when the
season permitted, and on the 16th of April encountered
the clans on <em>Culloden</em> moor. The regiment was in the
front line on this occasion, and took part in repulsing
the attacks of the Highlanders, and in driving them from
the field of battle with great slaughter. This victory
proved decisive, and the rebellion was suppressed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>The loss of the regiment was limited to seven private
soldiers killed and wounded. It was encamped a short
time at Inverness, and afterwards removed to Glasgow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1747</div>

<p>From Scotland, the regiment was again removed to
the theatre of the war in the Netherlands, where it
arrived in time to take part in the operations of the
campaign of 1747; and it was engaged at the battle of
<em>Val</em>, on the 2nd of July. On this occasion the allied
army was very inferior in numbers to the enemy, and
although the gallantry of the British infantry was very
conspicuous throughout the action, the Duke of Cumberland
was obliged to order a retreat to Maestricht.</p>

<p>Eight rank and file of the <span class="fs80">ROYAL NORTH BRITISH
FUSILIERS</span> were killed; one serjeant and fifteen rank and
file were wounded; and five men missing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1748</div>

<p>The regiment was again in the field in the summer of
1748. Hostilities were this year terminated by the
treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, and during the winter the
regiment returned to England.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1751</div>

the <span class="fs80">CIRCLE OF ST. ANDREW</span>, and the <span class="fs80">CROWN</span> over it; and
in the three corners of the second colour, the <span class="fs80">KING'S

<p>"On the grenadier caps, the <span class="fs80">THISTLE</span> as on the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>of arms, the <span class="fs80">THISTLE</span> and <span class="fs80">CROWN</span> to be painted, as on
the colours, with the rank of the regiment underneath."</p>

<p>During the period the regiment was stationed in
England, where it remained until 1751, it received
the commendations of His Royal Highness the Duke of
Cumberland, on account of its good conduct in quarters,
and of its former gallantry in the field.</p>

<p>The <span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST</span> regiment embarked for Gibraltar
towards the end of the year 1751, in order to relieve the
Eighth, or King's Regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1752</div>

<p>Lieut.-General Campbell was removed to the Scots
Greys, and King George II. nominated Colonel the
Earl of Panmure, from the Twenty-fifth regiment, to the
colonelcy of the <span class="fs80">ROYAL NORTH BRITISH FUSILIERS</span>, by
commission dated the 29th of April, 1752.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1760</div>

<p>The regiment remained at Gibraltar until 1760, when
it was relieved from duty at that fortress, and returned
to England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1761</div>

<p>In the meantime another war had commenced between
Great Britain and France, and in 1761 the <span class="fs80">ROYAL NORTH
BRITISH FUSILIERS</span>, mustering eight hundred men,
under the command of Lieut.-Colonel Edward Maxwell,
sailed with the expedition under Major-General
Hodgson, for the attack of the French island in the Bay
of Biscay, called <em>Belle-Isle</em>. The fleet appeared before
the island on the 7th of April; but the coast was found
like a vast fortress,&mdash;the little which nature had left
undone by rocks and crags, having been supplied by
art. A landing was, however, effected on the following
day; the <span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST</span> was one of the regiments which
leaped on shore, and stormed the works of Port Andro,
under a heavy fire of cannon and musketry; the works
were found too steep to be ascended, and although the
officers and soldiers made a gallant effort, one attempting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>to lift another up, it was found impossible to succeed,
and they were ordered to return on board of the fleet.
The regiment had three serjeants, one drummer, and
eight rank and file killed; eight rank and file wounded;
Lieutenants Innis and Ramage, and thirty-five rank and
file, prisoners;&mdash;many of the officers and soldiers taken
prisoners were severely wounded, and were unable to
return on board of the fleet when the order was given
to retire.</p>

<p>A landing was effected on the 22nd of April at a
rugged spot near Point Lomaria, where the difficult
ascent had occasioned the enemy to be less attentive to
that part of the coast; and the troops, under Brigadier-General
Lambert, having landed, gained the summit of
the rock, and repulsed the attempts of the enemy to
dislodge them,&mdash;capturing three brass field-pieces.
The cannon was afterwards landed from the ships, and
dragged up the rocks; the lines which covered the town
of Palais were captured, and the siege of the citadel
commenced. The <span class="fs80">ROYAL NORTH BRITISH FUSILIERS</span>
took part in the siege of the <em>Citadel</em> of <em>Belle-Isle</em>, which
was prosecuted with so much vigour, that the governor,
the Chevalier de St. Croix, was forced to surrender on the
7th of June. The capture of the island was thus effected,
with the loss of about eighteen hundred men killed and
wounded.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1762<br />1763<br />1764</div>

<p>After the surrender of the Castle of Belle-Isle, the
regiment returned to England, where it was stationed
in 1762; and in 1763 and 1764 it occupied quarters
in Scotland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1765<br />1770</div>

<p>On the 6th of May, 1765, the regiment embarked
for America, and was quartered five years in West
Florida; in 1770, it was removed to Canada, and was
stationed some time at Quebec.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>In November, 1770, Lieut.-General the Earl of
Panmure was removed to the Scots Greys, and was
succeeded in the colonelcy of the <span class="fs80">ROYAL NORTH BRITISH
FUSILIERS</span> by Major-General the Honorable Alexander
Mackay, from the Sixty-fifth regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1772<br />1773<br />1774</div>

<p>Having been relieved from duty at Quebec, in 1772,
the regiment embarked for England, where it was
stationed in 1773 and the two following years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1775</div>

<p>The American war commenced in 1775, and during
the winter of that year Quebec was besieged by an
American force.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1776</div>

<p>In the spring of 1776, the regiment embarked for
the relief of <em>Quebec</em>; on the arrival of the British
reinforcement to the garrison, the Americans raised the
siege, and made a precipitate retreat; they were pursued
up the country, and driven from all the posts which they
occupied in that province. After these services were
performed, the <span class="fs80">ROYAL NORTH BRITISH FUSILIERS</span> were
quartered at St. John's, where they were stationed during
the winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1777</div>

<p>The regiment was called into active operations in the
spring of 1777, with the armament commanded by
Lieut.-General Burgoyne; it embarked in boats on
Lake Champlain, and sailed to Crown Point, where the
troops halted three days, and afterwards proceeded
against Ticonderago; but the Americans quitted the
fort without hazarding the events of a siege. The
regiment returned on board of the flotilla, and sailing
along the lake, arrived, about three o'clock on the
afternoon of the 6th of July, within three miles of
Skenesborough, where the Americans had a stockaded
fort. The Ninth, Twentieth, and <span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST</span>
regiments leaped on shore, and ascended the mountains,
to get behind the fort and cut off the retreat of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
garrison; but the Americans made a precipitate retreat,
and escaped with the loss of a few men made prisoners.</p>

<p>On the 8th of July, the regiment was detached towards
Fort Anne, to support the Ninth, who were attacked by
an American force of very superior numbers. The
enemy was repulsed, and retreated towards Fort
Edward.</p>

<p>To follow up these advantages proved a difficult
undertaking; trees and other obstacles had to be
removed; creeks and marshes had to be crossed; forty
bridges had to be constructed; but by great exertion
these difficulties were overcome, and on the 30th of
July, the army arrived at the bank of the Hudson's
River, which was crossed by a bridge of boats on the
13th and 14th of September, and on the 19th the army
advanced against the Americans, in position on an island
called Still-Water, when a severe action was fought.
Lieut.-General Burgoyne stated in his public despatch,&mdash;"About
three o'clock, the action began by a very
vigorous attack on the British line, and was continued
with great obstinacy until after sunset; the enemy
being constantly supplied with fresh troops. The
stress lay upon the Twentieth, <span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST</span>, and
Sixty-second regiments, most parts of which were
engaged nearly four hours without intermission....
Just as night closed, the enemy gave ground on all
sides, and left us completely masters of the field of
battle."</p>

<p>Several other actions occurred, and the regiment
sustained considerable loss in killed and wounded;
among the former were Lieutenants Currie, Mackenzie,
Robertson, and Turnbull; and among the latter Captain
Ramsay, and Lieutenant Richardson.</p>

<p>The circumstances under which the troops commanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
by Lieut.-General Burgoyne eventually became placed,
assumed a desperate character; their numbers were reduced
to about three thousand five hundred men able
to bear arms; they were environed by sixteen thousand
Americans; their retreat cut off, and they were short of
provisions. Under these accumulated difficulties, they
agreed to lay down their arms on condition of being sent
to England, and of not serving again in North America
during the war. These conditions were, however,
violated by the American Congress, and the troops were
detained some time in the provinces.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1781</div>

<p>The <span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST</span> regiment having been liberated
returned to Europe, and in 1781 it was stationed in
Scotland, recruiting its numbers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1782</div>

<p>At the termination of the American war, in 1782, the
regiment was placed on the peace establishment; and in
1783 it proceeded to Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1789</div>

<p>The regiment remained in Ireland until the spring of
1789, when it embarked from Cork for Nova Scotia,
and landing at Halifax, was stationed in the British
provinces in North America nearly four years.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General the Honorable Alexander Mackay
died in 1789, and the colonelcy of the <span class="fs80">ROYAL NORTH
BRITISH FUSILIERS</span> was conferred on General the
Honorable James Murray, from the Thirteenth regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1793</div>

<p>While the regiment was in North America a revolution
took place in France, and republican principles
were extended to the French West India islands, where
the inhabitants of colour rose in arms against the European
settlers, many of whom sought protection from
Great Britain. Under these circumstances the <span class="fs80">ROYAL
NORTH BRITISH FUSILIERS</span> were removed to the West
Indies in the spring of 1793.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>The French royalists of <em>Martinique</em> sent pressing applications
for assistance, and Major-General Bruce, commanding
the British troops in the West Indies, was
induced to proceed with a small force to their aid. The
<span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST</span> were employed on this service; they
landed at Caise de Navire on the 14th of June; the other
corps landed on the 16th, and eleven hundred British,
and eight hundred French loyalists, advanced to attack
the town of St. Pierre: but the Royalists were undisciplined;
they got into confusion, fired by mistake on one
another, and so completely disconcerted the plan of
attack, that the English General, not having a force
sufficiently numerous for the purpose without them,
ordered the British troops to return on board of the
fleet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1794</div>

<p>General Sir Charles (afterwards Earl) Grey assembled
a body of troops at Barbadoes, in January, 1794, for
the attack of the French islands, and the flank companies
of the <span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST</span> were employed on this service.
A landing was effected on the island of <em>Martinique</em> in
the early part of February, and after some sharp fighting,
in which the regiment had several men killed and
wounded, this valuable possession was delivered from
the power of the republicans.</p>

<p>From Martinique the grenadiers, under Prince Edward
(afterwards Duke of Kent), the light infantry, under
Major-General Dundas, and three other corps, embarked
on the 30th of March for <em>St. Lucia</em>, where they arrived
on the 1st of April, and the conquest of that fine island
was completed in three days.</p>

<p>The flank companies of the <span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST</span> were afterwards
employed in the reduction of the island of
<em>Guadaloupe</em>. A determined resistance was made by the
enemy; but the island was captured before the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
April. The regiment had several men killed and
wounded; Captain Macdonald was also wounded on the
12th of April.</p>

<p>After the reduction of Guadaloupe, the flank companies
of the regiment were removed to Antigua.</p>

<p>The loss of so many valuable colonial possessions was
not regarded with indifference by the republican government
of France, and in June a French armament
arrived at <em>Guadaloupe</em> for the recovery of that island.
The negroes and other men of colour flocked to the
standard of republicanism; they were instantly armed
and clad in uniforms; the doctrines of liberty and equality
were disseminated among this motley crowd, which led to
a frightful catalogue of crime and bloodshed. The flank
companies of the <span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST</span> were called from
Antigua to aid in the defence of Guadaloupe; they
arrived on the 10th of June in the Winchelsea ship of
war, landed on the 19th, at Ance Canot, and were engaged
in several arduous services, in which Lieutenants
Harry Foley Price, Samuel Knollis, and J. S. Colepeper
were wounded; also several private soldiers killed and
wounded: but the British troops were not sufficiently
numerous to contend with the republican forces.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Colin Graham of the <span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST</span>
was appointed to the command of the troops in Basse
Terre, and he defended Beville camp until the 6th of
October, when he was forced to surrender, his force
having become reduced to one hundred and twenty-five
rank and file fit for duty.</p>

<p>Three companies of the <span class="fs80">ROYAL NORTH BRITISH
FUSILIERS</span> were engaged in the defence of <em>Fort Matilda</em>,
under Lieut.-General Prescott, and the garrison made a
resolute resistance, until the place became so much injured
by the enemy's fire that it was not tenable, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
it was evacuated during the night of the 10th of December.
One company of the <span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST</span> occupied the
rampart,&mdash;the light company, under Lieutenant William
Paterson, was stationed on the right of the breach, and
the third company, under Captain Mackay, was posted
along the Gallion river; they thus covered the embarkation
of the garrison and stores, and afterwards
retired on board of the fleet. The three companies
were reduced by casualties to one captain, three lieutenants,
six serjeants, and ninety-two rank and file.
Lieut.-General Prescott stated in his despatch,&mdash;"During
the whole progress of this long and painful siege, the
officers and men under my command have conducted
themselves in such a manner as to deserve my warmest
praise; bearing their hardships with the utmost
patience, and performing their duty with alacrity."</p>

<p>General the Honorable James Murray died in this
year, and King George III. nominated Major-General
James Hamilton from the Fifteenth regiment, to the
colonelcy of the <span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST FUSILIERS</span>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1795<br />1796</div>

<p>In addition to the casualties in action, the regiment
also sustained, during its services in the West Indies,
severe loss from the yellow fever, and in 1796 it returned
to England much reduced in numbers; it landed at
Portsmouth, and proceeded from thence to Scotland,
where it commenced active measures for completing its
ranks with recruits.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1800<br />1801<br />1802</div>

<p>The regiment occupied various stations in Scotland
until June, 1800, when it embarked from Portpatrick
for Ireland, where its numbers were increased to eight
hundred rank and file by volunteers from the Scots
fencible regiments then in that country.</p>

<p>In October of the same year, the regiment marched to
Enniskillen, where it was quartered nearly two years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
during which time its numbers were increased to a
thousand men by recruits. The good conduct of the
regiment, during its stay at this place, occasioned it to
stand very high in the estimation of the inhabitants;
and on its removal, in 1802, a hundred gentlemen and
respectable persons sent a memorial to the Commander-in-chief,
requesting that it might be again quartered at
Enniskillen, and offered to defray the expense of removal.</p>

<p>On the 15th of July, 1802, the regiment arrived at
Londonderry, where its establishment was reduced in
consequence of the peace of Amiens having been concluded
with France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1803</div>

<p>From Londonderry the regiment was removed to
Dublin, in February, 1803; its establishment was again
augmented in the summer of this year after the renewal
of hostilities with France.</p>

<p>An alarming insurrectionary spirit was manifested at
<em>Dublin</em> in the summer of this year; and on the evening
of the 23rd of July an immense number of persons
assembled with fire-arms and pikes, dragged the Lord
Chief-Justice, Viscount Kilwarden, out of his carriage,
and murdered him; also wounded his nephew, the Rev.
Richard Wolfe, and committed numerous other acts of
outrage and violence. At this period the regiment was
quartered in Cork Street, Thomas Street, and Coombe
Barracks, and it quickly assembled to suppress the riots.
Lieut.-Colonel Brown was murdered by the insurgents
as he was proceeding from his quarters to head the regiment.
The command devolved on Major Robertson,
under whose orders the regiment was actively employed
in restoring tranquillity, in which service it had twelve
men killed and wounded. The regiment received the
thanks and approbation of the Commander-in-chief in
Ireland, Lieut.-General the Honorable H. E. Fox, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
its conduct on this occasion. Also the thanks of the
city of Dublin. Lieutenant Douglas, who commanded
the light company, and Adjutant Brady, particularly
distinguished themselves, and were each presented with
a piece of plate by the city of Dublin, accompanied with
the expression of the gratitude and admiration of the
citizens, for their gallant exertions.</p>

<p>On the decease of General Hamilton, in this year, he
was succeeded in the colonelcy by General the Honorable
William Gordon, from the Seventy-first regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1804</div>

<p>Leaving Dublin in July, 1804, the regiment proceeded
to Loughrea.</p>

<p>Napoleon Bonaparte, whom the French had elevated
to the dignity of Emperor, having made preparations
for the invasion of England, his menace was met by a
meritorious display of loyalty and patriotism by the
British people, who armed to repel the threatened invasion.
Among the precautionary measures adopted at
this period, an "Additional Force Act" received the
Royal Assent in July, 1804. The men raised for limited
service, under the provisions of this Act, in the counties
of Ayr and Renfrew, were added to the <span class="fs80">ROYAL NORTH
BRITISH FUSILIERS</span>, and were formed into a <em>second battalion</em>,
which was embodied at Ayr, and placed on the establishment
of the army on the 25th of December, 1804.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1805</div>

<p>On the 30th of April, 1805, the first battalion embarked
from Monkstown for England; it landed at
Portsmouth, and was subsequently encamped at Weymouth,
where several corps were assembled, and were
repeatedly reviewed by the King, and other members of
the Royal Family, who expressed their high approbation
of the <span class="fs80">ROYAL NORTH BRITISH FUSILIERS</span> on every occasion
on which the corps appeared before them. In the
autumn the battalion marched to Lewes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1806</div>

<p>From Lewes the first battalion marched to London,
in January, 1806, to attend the funeral of Vice Admiral
<span class="smcap">Lord Viscount Nelson</span>, who was killed at the
battle of Trafalgar, where the British navy gained a
decisive victory over the combined fleets of France and
Spain. The remains of this highly distinguished naval
commander were honored with a public funeral, which
was conducted with great state. The interment took
place on the 9th of January, in St. Paul's Cathedral: the
<span class="fs80">ROYAL NORTH BRITISH FUSILIERS</span> afterwards marched to
Colchester.</p>

<p>At this period the French arms were triumphant in
Germany; and the Court of Naples having displeased
the Emperor Napoleon, the Neapolitan territory was
seized by the armies of France, and Joseph Bonaparte
was proclaimed King of Naples. The British preserved
the island of Sicily in the interest of the dethroned
family: and in April the first battalion of the <span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST</span>
embarked from Tilbury for Sicily, and landed at
Messina on the 26th of July.</p>

<p>On the 15th of August the second battalion embarked
from Portpatrick for Ireland, where it was stationed
during the following five years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1807</div>

<p>The Court of the Grand Seignior having become
involved in hostilities with Great Britain, the first battalion
embarked from Sicily on the 17th of May, 1807, and
joined the expedition to Egypt under Major-General
Alexander Mackenzie Fraser. The battalion landed
at Alexandria, and marched to the camp at Aboukir.
Peace having been concluded with the Turks, the battalion
returned to Sicily, where it arrived in October.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1808</div>

<p>The first battalion occupied quarters in Sicily during
the year 1808.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1809</div>

<p>In June, 1809, Lieut.-General Sir John Stuart, com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>manding
in chief in the Mediterranean, resolved to
menace the capital and kingdom of Naples, as a diversion
in favour of the Austrians, who were contending
against numerous difficulties in their war with France.
The flank companies of the <span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST</span> were employed
on this service; and after menacing a considerable
extent of coast, which produced much alarm, the romantic
and fruitful island of <em>Ischia</em>, celebrated for the beauty
of its scenery, and situate in the Bay of Naples, about
six miles from the coast, was attacked. A landing was
effected in the face of a formidable line of batteries, from
which the enemy was speedily driven; Lieut. Cameron
of the <span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST</span>, who was attached to the British
flotilla, attacked the enemy's gun-boats with great gallantry,
and captured twenty-four of their number; but
was mortally wounded at the moment of victory. The
siege of the castle was undertaken, and in a few days
the garrison was forced to surrender. The island of
<em>Procida</em> surrendered on being summoned. Two valuable
islands were thus rescued from the power of
General Murat, whom the Emperor Napoleon had
nominated King of Naples, in succession to Joseph
Bonaparte, upon whom the Emperor had conferred the
crown of Spain; and one thousand five hundred regular
troops, with one hundred pieces of ordnance, were
captured.</p>

<p>An attempt was, at this period, made to reduce the
castle of <em>Scylla</em>; but the large force, which the enemy
possessed in Calabria, rendered this impracticable. The
battalion companies of the regiment were employed in
this service, and had Captain Hunter killed, eight rank
and file killed and wounded.</p>

<p>A detachment of the regiment was sent, at the request<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of the inhabitants, to the town of Valmi, for the protection
of the place; but was intercepted by the enemy,
and Captains Mackay and Conran, Lieutenants M'Nab
and Mackay, four serjeants, two drummers, and seventy-six
rank and file, were made prisoners.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1810</div>

<p>In the summer of 1810, General Murat assembled
upwards of one hundred heavy gun-boats, a number of
others more lightly armed, and about four hundred
transport-boats, and brought thirty thousand troops to
the coast of Calabria for the purpose of invading Sicily.
The <span class="fs80">ROYAL NORTH BRITISH FUSILIERS</span> were employed
on the coast watching the approach of the enemy, and
were at the alarm-post, under arms, every morning, two
hours before daylight, for several months. During a
dark night between the 17th and 18th of September,
four thousand men, under General Cavaignac, made good
their passage, and commenced landing about seven miles
to the southward of Messina. The alarm being given,
the <span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST</span> regiment, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel
Adam (now General the Right Honorable Sir
Frederick Adam, G.C.B., Colonel of the <span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST
ROYAL NORTH BRITISH FUSILIERS</span>), hurried to the spot,
accompanied by two field-pieces which were attached to
the regiment, and prevented several of the boats from
reaching the shore: as the boats were retiring, a few of
them were sunk by the fire of the field-pieces. The
regiment next turned towards that portion of the enemy
which had landed, and had taken post on two hills.
The flankers were thrown out, and a fire of musketry
was kept up until daylight, when the enemy, being cut
off from the boats and surrounded, surrendered prisoners
of war, delivering up one stand of colours. The prisoners,
amounting to about one thousand officers and soldiers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
were marched to Messina. This repulse, with the destruction
of many of the enemy's gun-boats, by the
British and Sicilian flotillas, disconcerted the plans of
Murat, and no further attempts were made against Sicily.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1811</div>

<p>In September, 1811, the second battalion embarked
from Belfast for Scotland; and in this year it sent a
strong detachment, with a number of volunteers from
the militia, to Sicily, which increased the strength of
the first battalion to twelve hundred rank and file.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1812</div>

<p>Meanwhile the British army, commanded by Lord
Wellington, now Field-Marshal the <span class="smcap">Duke of Wellington</span>,
was fighting the battle of Spanish and Portuguese
independence in the Peninsula; and in November, 1812,
the grenadier company of the <span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST FUSILIERS</span>
proceeded, with the grenadier battalion, to the eastern
coast of Spain, to take part in the war. It arrived at
Alicant, on the 2nd of December; but circumstances
occurred soon afterwards, which occasioned its return
to Sicily, where it arrived in the spring of 1813.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1813</div>

<p>Two companies proceeded, in 1813, to the island of
Ponza; and in the same year, a strong detachment,
commanded by Captain Renny, joined from the second
battalion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1814</div>

<p>The brilliant success of the British troops in the
Peninsula, and of the armies of the Allied Sovereigns
on the Continent of Europe, was followed by the embarkation
of a body of troops for Italy, under Lieut.-General
Lord William Bentinck and Major-General H.
T. Montresor. The <span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST</span> regiment embarked
for this service, in February, 1814, under Major Whitaker
(Colonel Paterson commanding a brigade), and landed at
Leghorn on the 13th of March; on the 23rd it marched
to Pisa, and on the 25th to Lucca. In April, the battalion
advanced upon <em>Genoa</em>; on the 12th of that month, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
enemy was driven from Mount Facia and Nervi, and the
British took post at Sturla. On the 17th of April, at
daybreak, the French position in front of Genoa was
attacked, the enemy was driven from the strong position
he occupied, and afterwards evacuated the town, which
was taken possession of on the 19th of April, by the
<span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST</span>, and other corps. The regiment had
Lieutenant Sabine wounded; one serjeant and fourteen
rank and file killed and wounded.</p>

<p>In the meantime the second battalion had been
withdrawn from Scotland, to take part in the war on
the Continent; it embarked from Fort George, on the
30th of December, 1813, landed in Holland on the
10th of January, 1814, and was employed in the attack
of <em>Bergen-op-Zoom</em>, on the night of the 8th of March.
One portion of the battalion formed part of the third
column, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel <span class="smcap">Robert
Henry</span>, of the <span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST</span>, who was directed to draw
the enemy's attention by an attack near Steenbergen
gate; the flank companies were attached to the fourth
column, under Brigadier-General Gore. Some severe
fighting took place, and advantages were gained in the
first instance; but the attack failed, and a number of
officers and men, who had penetrated the works, were
forced to surrender prisoners of war. The battalion
had a number of men killed and wounded on this
occasion; Lieutenant John Bulteel died of his wounds;
Lieut.-Colonel Henry, Captains Durrah and Donald
Mackenzie, Lieutenants the Honorable F. Morris,
H. Pigou, D. Moody, D. Rankin, and Sir William
Crosby, were wounded. Hostilities were soon afterwards
terminated; Napoleon Bonaparte abdicated the
throne of France; and in September the second battalion
embarked from Ostend for England; it landed at Deal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
and in October embarked from Gravesend for Scotland,
where it arrived in the beginning of November, and
landed at Leith.</p>

<p>The war in Europe having terminated, the first battalion
of the <span class="fs80">ROYAL NORTH BRITISH FUSILIERS</span> was selected
to proceed to America, in consequence of Great Britain
having become involved in war with the United States;
it embarked from Genoa on the 12th of May, and
arrived at Gibraltar on the 7th of June; and on the
11th, sailed with the Twenty-ninth and Sixty-second
regiments, for the West Indies, where it joined the
corps under Major-General Robert Ross. The fleet,
with the troops on board, sailed from Bermuda on the
3rd of August, and proceeded to the Bay of Chesapeake,
when the American flotilla fled for refuge up the
Patuxent river. To ensure the capture or destruction
of this flotilla, the troops landed at the village of St.
Benedict, from whence they advanced to the delightful
village of Upper Marlborough, when the Americans
destroyed their flotilla to prevent its falling into the
hands of the British. The object of the expedition had
thus been accomplished; but the army had advanced
within sixteen miles of <em>Washington</em>, and the enemy's
force was ascertained to be such as would authorise an
attempt to carry the capital. The troops accordingly
advanced on the 23rd of August; routed some detachments
on the road, and encountering the American
army under General Winder, at the village of <em>Bladensburg</em>,
gained a decisive victory over a force more than
twice their own numbers, and occupying a position
deliberately chosen. The light company of the regiment
distinguished itself on this occasion; it had two
men killed; Captain Robert Rennie, Lieutenant James
Grace, and eleven rank and file wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Advancing from the field of battle, the regiment
moved towards <em>Washington</em>, and was the first corps
which entered that city; it was fired upon by the
Americans, and had sixty-eight men killed and wounded;
but all resistance was soon overcome: the arsenal, docks,
and other public property were set on fire, and the
conflagration of burning buildings illuminated the sky
during the night, while the exploding magazines shook
the city, and threw down houses in their vicinity.
Having completed this service, the British troops
marched back to St. Benedict, and re-embarked on board
of the fleet.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 12th of September, the
troops landed at North Point, and advancing towards
Baltimore, a division of Americans fled from an entrenched
position which they were preparing across a
neck of land. Continuing to advance, the troops
entered a closely wooded country, where they encountered
a party of Americans, and Major-General
Robert Ross, mixing among the skirmishers, was mortally
wounded,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> when the command of the army devolved
on Colonel Brooke.</p>

<p>Six thousand Americans, with six pieces of artillery
and a corps of cavalry, were discovered in position in
<em>Godly wood</em>. The light brigade extended and drove in
the American skirmishers; the Forty-fourth, a party of
Marines, and a body of seamen from the fleet, formed
line behind the light infantry; the <span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST</span>,
commanded by Major Whitaker, (Colonel Paterson
commanding a brigade,) and the second battalion of
Marines, formed column in reserve, and the Fourth
regiment made a flank movement to turn the enemy's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>left. The signal was given, the British troops rushed
to the attack, and in fifteen minutes the American army
was driven from the field with severe loss.</p>

<p>The regiment had Lieutenant James Gracie and
fifteen rank and file killed; Major Robert Kenny,
Lieutenant John Leavock, two serjeants, and seventy-seven
rank and file wounded.</p>

<p>Colonel Paterson was commended in the public despatch,
for the steady manner in which he brought the
brigade into action.</p>

<p>At two o'clock on the following morning the march was
resumed, and in the evening the troops arrived at the
foot of the range of hills in front of <em>Baltimore</em>, where
fifteen thousand Americans occupied a chain of palisaded
redoubts, connected by breastworks, and defended by a
numerous artillery. Trusting to the innate valour of his
little army, which did not amount to one-third of the
numbers of the enemy, Colonel Brooke made preparations
for storming the hills after dark; but having received
intimation from the fleet, that the entrance of the harbour
was closed up by vessels sunk for that purpose,
and that a naval co-operation against the town and camp
was impracticable, the enterprise was abandoned. The
troops retreated three miles on the following day, and
then halted to see if the Americans would venture to
descend from the hills; but, though so superior in
numbers, they had no disposition to quit their works;
and the British returned on board the fleet.</p>

<p>The season for active operations having passed, the
fleet quitted the American coast, and the <span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST</span>
proceeded to Jamaica, where they were joined by a strong
detachment from the second battalion, commanded by
Major Alexander James Ross.</p>

<p>An attempt on <em>New Orleans</em> was afterwards resolved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
upon. The fleet again put to sea, and on the 10th of December
anchored off the coast of Louisiana, opposite the
Chandeleur Islands, from whence the troops were removed
in boats to Pine Island, in Lake Borgne, where
they were stationed, exposed to heavy rain by day and
frosts by night, until the 22nd of December, when the
first division proceeded in open boats to a desert spot
about eight miles from New Orleans, where the regiments
landed, and marched to a field on the banks of the Mississippi.
The <span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST</span> followed, and arrived in
time to take part in repulsing a night attack of a very
superior force of Americans, when the regiment had
Captain William Conran and two rank and file killed;
one serjeant, two drummers, and eight rank and file
wounded; two men missing.</p>

<p>The army afterwards moved forward, but encountered
many local difficulties. The Americans assembled a
numerous force, in extensive fortified lines and batteries,
with armed vessels on the river: the advance was checked,
and some loss sustained. The <span class="fs80">ROYAL NORTH BRITISH
FUSILIERS</span> had Lieutenant John Leavock wounded;
also several men killed and wounded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1815</div>

<p>Arrangements were made for attacking the enemy's
fortified lines on the 8th of January, 1815, and the
<span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST</span> were appointed to take part in this
service: several circumstances occurred to delay the
attack, which was made under numerous disadvantages.
The troops, however, rushed forward with great gallantry,
and a detachment of the Fourth, <span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST</span>,
and Ninety-fifth (now Rifle-Brigade), captured a battery;
but the troops were exposed to a dreadful fire, which
brought them down by hundreds. Major-General the
Honorable Sir Edward Pakenham was killed; Major-Generals
Gibbs and Keane were dangerously wounded;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and success being found impracticable, the surviving
officers and men withdrew from the unequal contest.
Many officers and soldiers, who had been foremost in the
attack, were made prisoners.</p>

<p>Major J. A. Whitaker, Captain Robert Renny (Lieut.-Colonel),
Lieutenant Donald M<sup>c</sup>Donald, two serjeants,
and sixty-five rank and file of the <span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST</span>, were
killed; Colonel William Paterson, Major Alexander
James Ross, Lieutenants John Waters and Alexander
Geddes, six serjeants, and one hundred and forty-four
rank and file wounded; Lieutenants James Brady,
Ralph Carr, and Peter Quin wounded and taken
prisoners; Major James M<sup>c</sup>Haffie, Captain Archibald
Kidd, Lieutenants James Stewart, Alexander Armstrong,
John Leavock, and J. S. M. Fonblanque, eight
serjeants, two drummers, and two hundred and seventeen
rank and file, prisoners: total loss, 451 officers and
soldiers.</p>

<p>The capture of New Orleans appearing to be impracticable,
the troops returned on board of the fleet.
Fort Bowyer was afterwards captured, but hostilities
were terminated by a treaty of peace, and the regiment
returned to the West Indies, from whence Major Pringle
sailed for England, on leave of absence, and the command
devolved on Major Quin.</p>

<p>After a short stay at Bermuda, the regiment sailed for
Europe; it arrived at Portsmouth in May, and afterwards
sailed to Cork, where it landed in June.</p>

<p>In the spring of this year Bonaparte had returned to
France and gained temporary possession of that kingdom:
but his numerous veteran legions were overpowered by
British valour at Waterloo on the 18th of June. The
British army had, however, sustained severe loss, and
the first battalion was selected to proceed to the Con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>tinent.
It embarked from Monkstown on the 5th of
July, landed at Ostend on the 17th, and proceeding up
the country under Lieut.-Colonel Maxwell, joined the
army, commanded by Field-Marshal the Duke of Wellington,
at Paris.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1816</div>

<p>Having been appointed to remain on the Continent,
and to form part of the Army of Occupation in France, the
regiment marched to Compiègne, and occupied several
villages in the neighbourhood of that place, where it was
joined, on the 9th of January, 1816, by a detachment
from the second battalion.</p>

<p>On the 13th of January, 1816, the second battalion
was disbanded at Stirling; transferring the men fit for
duty to the first battalion.</p>

<p>Towards the end of January, the regiment was removed
to Valenciennes, and in October was reviewed,
with the Army of Occupation, by Field-Marshal the
Duke of Wellington.</p>

<p>On the death of General the Honorable William
Gordon, Lieut.-General James Lord Forbes was appointed
Colonel of the regiment, from the Fifty-fourth
foot, by commission dated the 1st of June, 1816.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1817</div>

<p>A considerable reduction being made in the British
contingent of the Army of Occupation, the regiment proceeded
to Calais, where it embarked for England, and
landed at Harwich on the 2nd of April, 1817.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1818</div>

<p>In May, 1818, the regiment marched to Portsmouth.</p>

<p>In June, the officers were authorised to wear a long
coat, of a pattern approved of by His Royal Highness
the Duke of York.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1819</div>

<p>The regiment embarked from Portsmouth, in March,
1819, for the West Indies, when Lieut.-Colonel Nooth,
C.B., received the following communication from Major-General
Lord Howard of Effingham, then commanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
at Portsmouth, and Lieutenant-Governor of that fortress:
"I am not in the habit of giving out orders of thanks to
regiments on quitting my district, because these things
are apt to degenerate so much into words of course,
that they lose any value they might otherwise possess;
my orders likewise to corps on their half-yearly inspections
enable me to convey to them my opinion on their
state of discipline, &amp;c.; but I cannot, however, allow
the <span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST</span> regiment, under your command, to
embark without expressing the sense I have of the
good conduct of the regiment since it has been under
my orders, and that its interior discipline, mode of
doing duty, and external appearance, have been such as
to merit my perfect approbation, and amply testify the
strict attention paid by you to those under your command,&mdash;that
you are properly supported by the officers
and non-commissioned officers, in their respective
stations, in carrying into effect the regulations of the
service." His Lordship was also pleased to express
his admiration of the conduct of the corps on the day
of embarkation, adding,&mdash;"The regiment is more like
one parading for inspection or review, than for embarkation
for the West Indies."</p>

<p>The regiment landed at Barbadoes in April, without
a single casualty, and was inspected by Lieut.-General
Lord Combermere, who requested Major Meyrick to
return the officers his lordship's thanks, for the very
great attention they must have paid to those under their
orders, to have brought them to the very high state of
discipline in which his lordship found them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1820<br />1821</div>

<p>In September, 1820, a detachment of one hundred
rank and file proceeded to Tobago, where it remained
until January, 1821, during which period it lost four
officers and thirty-seven men by an epidemic disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>The regiment left Barbadoes in March, 1821, when
seven companies proceeded to Demerara, under Major
Leahy, and three to Berbice, under Major Champion.
Previous to its quitting Barbadoes, Major-General Mainwaring
expressed in orders, "the high sense he entertained
of the zeal and ability of Major Leahy, of the
steady conduct of the officers and non-commissioned
officers, and of the good and orderly behaviour of
the men."</p>

<p>In August, the regiment sustained a severe loss in the
death of Lieut.-Colonel John M. Nooth, C.B.: he was
succeeded in the command by Lieut.-Colonel John
Thomas Leahy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1823</div>

<p>Insurrectionary movements having been made by the
negroes in the district of Mahaica, in the island of Demerara,
in August, 1823, the <span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST FUSILIERS</span>,
under Lieut.-Colonel Leahy, were employed in reducing
the revolted slaves to obedience, in which they succeeded.
For their excellent conduct on this occasion,
the <span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST</span> received the thanks of Lieut.-General
Sir Henry Ward, K.C.B., commanding in the Windward
and Leeward Islands; of the Court of Policy of the
Colony; of His Royal Highness the Duke of York,
the Commander-in-chief; and of His Majesty King
George IV.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1824</div>

<p>From Demerara the head-quarters were removed to
St. Vincent, in January, 1824, and received the thanks
of Major-General Murray, previous to embarking. At
the same time the Court of Policy voted, as a special
and permanent mark of the high estimation in which the
inhabitants of the Colony held the services of Lieut.-Colonel
Leahy, the officers and soldiers, "<span class="fs80">FIVE HUNDRED
GUINEAS TO BE LAID OUT IN THE PURCHASE OF PLATE
FOR THE REGIMENTAL MESS</span>," and <span class="fs80">TWO HUNDRED GUINEAS<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
FOR THE PURCHASE OF A SWORD FOR LIEUT.-COLONEL
LEAHY</span>; also <span class="fs80">FIFTY GUINEAS FOR THE PURCHASE OF A
SWORD FOR LIEUTENANT BRADY</span>, who commanded a
detachment at Mahaica, and whose cool, steady, and
intrepid conduct, aided by the courage and discipline
of his men, gave an early and effectual check to the
progress of revolt in that quarter.</p>

<p>In May, two companies were removed to Grenada.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1827</div>

<p>In December, 1826, and January, 1827, the regiment
embarked from St. Vincent and Grenada, for England,
after eight years' service in the West Indies, during
which period it had lost, by disease, fourteen officers
and four hundred men. Previous to quitting those
colonies, it received the expression of the approbation
and thanks of Admiral Sir Charles Brisbane, G.C.B.,
Governor of St. Vincent; of the Council of that island;
and of the Commander of the forces in the Windward
and Leeward Islands. It landed at Cowes, in the Isle
of Wight, in January, February, and March, and was
removed to Windsor, where it had the honor of doing
duty during His Majesty's residence at that place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1828</div>

<p>From Windsor the regiment was removed to Winchester,
in the spring of 1828, and afterwards to Portsmouth;
it was subsequently stationed at Bath, and in
October embarked from Bristol for Ireland: it landed
at Waterford, from whence it proceeded to Fermoy.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1829<br />1830</div>

<p>The regiment was removed to Mullingar, in June,
1829; and in May, 1830, the head-quarters proceeded
to Kilkenny, with parties at Carlow, Athy, Maryborough,
and Wexford.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1831<br />1832</div>

<p>In September, 1831, the regiment marched for Dublin,
where it embarked for England in October, and landing
at Liverpool, afterwards proceeded to Weedon. In
1832 it was removed to Chatham.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1833</div>

<p>During the years 1832 and 1833, the regiment embarked,
by detachments, in charge of convicts, for New
South Wales, and it was stationed in Australia and
Van Diemen's Land until the year 1839.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1839</div>

<p>Five companies and head-quarters embarked from
Hobart Town, in February, 1839, for the East Indies,
and arriving at Calcutta in May, afterwards proceeded
to Chinsurah. They were followed by two companies
from Hobart Town in March, 1840; and two from the
Swan River settlement in July.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1840</div>

<p>In April, 1840, the head-quarters were removed to
Calcutta; and in August, the regiment embarked for
Dinapore, where it arrived in September.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1841</div>

<p>The regiment was stationed at Dinapore during the
year 1841.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1842<br />1843</div>

<p>Leaving Dinapore in November, 1842, the regiment
commenced its march for Agra: but on arriving at
Mirzapoor, its destination was changed to Kamptee, at
which place it arrived on the 6th of February, 1843.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1844</div>

<p>During the year 1844, the regiment remained at
Kamptee.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1845</div>

<p>The regiment commenced its march from Kamptee
<em>en route</em> to the north-western provinces of Bengal on the
6th of December, 1845, and arrived at Jubbulpore on
the 30th of that month.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1846</div>

<p>The regiment resumed its march on the 1st of
January, 1846, and arrived at Agra on the 7th of
February, where it was stationed during the remainder
of the year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1847</div>

<p>Leaving Agra on the 15th of January, 1847, the
regiment arrived at Cawnpore on the 1st of February.
From Cawnpore the regiment proceeded, in November,
to Calcutta, at which place it arrived on the 30th of
December.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Orders were at this period given for the return to
England of the <span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST, ROYAL NORTH BRITISH
FUSILIERS</span>, and three hundred and ninety-three soldiers
transferred their services to other regiments remaining
in India.</p>

<p>In January, 1848, the regiment, under the command
of Lieutenant-Colonel John Thomas Hill, embarked at
Calcutta, and arrived at Gravesend on the 11th of May.</p>

<p>The regiment was, in the first instance, stationed at
Canterbury, from which city it proceeded to Edinburgh
in July, 1848.</p>

<p>On the 1st of June, 1849, the period to which this
Record has been continued, the regiment continued to
be stationed at Edinburgh Castle, under the command of
Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Gore Browne.</p>

<h2><a name="CONCLUSION" id="CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION.</a></h2>

<p>The foregoing pages contain numerous instances of
the valuable qualities of the <span class="fs80">ROYAL NORTH BRITISH
FUSILIERS</span>. The campaigns of King William III., and the
victories obtained by the Duke of Marlborough, afforded
many opportunities for the <span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST REGIMENT</span>
to evince its bravery. In subsequent years the battles
of <em>Dettingen</em>, <em>Fontenoy</em>, <em>Culloden</em>, and <em>Val</em>, enhanced its
former renown;&mdash;at the capture of <em>Belle-Isle</em> in 1761
the regiment sustained its previous character;&mdash;and the
several actions during the American war increased its
fame. Its services in Naples and Sicily in 1809 and
1810;&mdash;and the arduous duties on which it was employed
in America in 1814, gave additional proofs of its
capabilities.</p>

<p>The Regimental Record contains also many instances
of the expression of commendation by the General Officers,
under whose command the Regiment has served,
for its activity, discipline, and good conduct, when employed
on home or colonial duties, and when occasions
have occurred where military force has been
required in aid of the Civil Power, and where judgment,
temper, and firmness have been the means of
subduing the most violent commotions.</p>

<p>These qualities, which have been evinced for the long
period of one hundred and seventy years, have rendered
the <span class="fs80">TWENTY-FIRST REGIMENT</span>, or <span class="fs80">THE ROYAL NORTH
BRITISH FUSILIERS</span>, an ornament in the British Army,
and have acquired the Approbation of the Sovereign
and the Confidence of the Country.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> This nobleman was John (sixth) Earl of Mar, the son of Charles
(fifth) Earl of Mar, who raised the <span class="smcap">Twenty-first</span> regiment, and
was the first colonel of that regiment. On his decease, on the 23rd
of April, 1689, his son John became Earl of Mar, and was honored
with several appointments by Queen Anne. Upon the arrival of
King George I., he was informed that his services were no longer
required as Third Secretary of State, and he retired to his estates in
Scotland where he raised a rebellion, and proclaimed the Pretender
at Kirk-Michael, in Perthshire, on the 11th of September, 1715.
After the defeat of the rebels at Sheriff-muir, he escaped from Scotland,
and in 1716, was attainted of high treason. He followed the
Pretender to Rome, and remained in his service until 1721, when
he removed to Paris where he remained until 1729. From Paris he
retired to Aix-la-Chapelle, where he died, in May, 1732. His son,
Thomas, Lord Erskine, enjoyed his father's forfeited estates, which
were conveyed to him in 1739 by his uncle, Mr. Erskine of Grange,
who bought them of the Commissioners for the benefit of his nephew.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
